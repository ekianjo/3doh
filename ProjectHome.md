# What's this? #
3d'oh! A libre (GPL) 3do emulator for GNU/Linux, built around SDL for audio, video and input. It also includes an optional binding for OpenGL video output, that enables a nice video scaling/stretch.

# Status #
  * Raphael Guyot has reported that the emu works on Pandora!
  * I've tested myself that emu compiles and run in Debian ARM.
  * I'm working on a Dreamcast port  (running over KallistiOS). I know that it will not run fullspeed or any playable speed, but it's just for fun and to show the portability of the emu.


# Legal Stuff #
3d'oh! uses Freedo (http://www.freedo.org) as the core emulator. Freedo is a (great) 3do emulation library made by Alexander Troosh, Maxim Grishin, Allen Wright, John Sammons and Felix Lazarev.

3d'oh! also uses some code and ideas from 4do (http://www.fourdo.com), a 3do emulator that also uses freedo, but this one is written in C#.

License: 3d'oh! it's released under the GPLv2 license.
